This document provides information on how to generate prototypes, 
simulate these using various weather files and generate regression
equations for use in HUE.

1. Registering prototypes:
Run the script 01.proto_reg to register prototypes. This makes a large
number of ESP-r configuration files.

2. Generate prototypes:
Run the script 02.proto_gen to generate prototypes. This makes
supporting zones files.

3. Simulate prototypes:
Run the script 03.proto_sim to simulate the prototypes. An alternate
script called 03.proto_sim_pp exists in the src folder for running
simulations on a parallel processing super computer. This script
was developed for use on the University of Strathclyde high performance
computer details of which can be found at http://use-hpc.eng.strath.ac.uk.

4. Generate regression equations:
Run the script 04.MLR_eqn_gen to generate regression equations for the
monthly energy performance of each prototype. This is a fortran program
that should be compiled from the source file 04.MLR_eqn_gen.F in the
src folder.

5. Cleanup:
Run the program 05.cleanup to clean up all the files created during the
above process.
