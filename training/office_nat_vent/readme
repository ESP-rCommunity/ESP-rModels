The Office_vent_pre folder contains a fully populated
portion of an office block which explores the use of
pre-defined object for internal mass and visual studies.
The configuration files are as follows:

office_vent_pre.cfg - with standard seasons (save level 4).
office_vent_pre_nu.cfg - with annual assessment save level 2.

The images folder includes images of the expected 
performance of the model assuming an Ottawa Canada
climate. The rad folder has the radiance files for
various views.

WARNING - this model has zones with lots of surfaces so
ESP-r needs to have been compiled with the *large.h
header files.
