trombe_wall_office_cr3d.cfg represents an office with a south facing
Trombe-michelle wall. The wall is represented in three sections
and the facade air space is split into four vertical sections
with a small vertical bypass zone to aid the circulation of
air within the facade.

The flow network is designed to represent the air movement in
the facade. There are dampers/grills connecting the facade and the
office which open if the Trombe space is warmer than the office. 
There are also small dampers between the outside and facade
at the top and bottom which open if the Trombe space overheats.

It is also shows the use of a small vertical (bypass) zone which
allows downdrafts and mixing of flows within a vertical
space when the dampers are closed.

The model is useful for demonstrating mass thermal storage
and the movement of heat from the facade into the office. The
trombe_wall_office model shows a delay of approximately 12 hours
in the peak trombe wall temperatures on the facade face and
the office face.

The flow network was created via surface attributes and then
adapted after several rounds of assessments. The size of the
dampers/grills probably should be larger to allow for greater
natural flows into the office.
