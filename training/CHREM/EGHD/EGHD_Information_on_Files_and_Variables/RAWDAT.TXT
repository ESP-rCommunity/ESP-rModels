 VNTTYP            - Central ventilation system type (1..3, List 11)

Notes:

1) Heat gain from occupants (OCCHTG) must be calculated by the interface,
based on the number of people in each category (adults, children, infants),
and the % of time each are in the home, as follows.

      OCCHTG = .016 * Real( # of adults) * (occupancy time adults % ) + 
     x         .008 * (
     x  Real(# children) * (time %) + Real(# infants) * (time %) )

2) The default value for domestic hot water consumption is calculated
internally by the core if the corresponding flag, RAWDAT.GenDes[17-1], has
been set to 1 (Use defaults).  The values are derived as follows (in Fortran).

      j = NumOcc[0] + NumOcc[1] + NumOcc[2]
! Default based on # of occupants
      HOTWAT = Real ( 85 + 35 * j ) ! Litres/day
      If ( IUNITS .ne. 'M' ) HOTWAT = HOTWAT * 0.2199692 ! Imp. gal/day
      If ( IUNITS .eq. 'U' ) HOTWAT = HOTWAT * 1.20095   ! U.S. gal/day

3) The daily electric baseload, BASELD, must be calculated by the interface,
based on the inputs, as follows.

! Total daily electrical load (kWh/day)
!             Int. Lights   Int. Appl.   Int. Other
      BASELD = GenDat[11] + GenDat[12] + GenDat[13] + ExtElc 


4) NumCmp: value is defined in NumCmp.cmn
