System configuration file: heat_transfer.cfg
Synopsis: Matrix of small offices with different heat transfer methods
Created: Mon Jan  3 08:25:47 2022
Notes:
A dozen small offices with associated corridors exploring different
environmental controls and matching heat transfer methods.

It includes explicit ceiling voids. The upper and lower voids
are temperature matched to the middle ceiling void.

heat_transfer.cfg - this includes convective sensing in underfloor heating
room as well as a matching control for the upper and lower bounding zones.

heat_transfer_mixed.cfg  - uses mixed sensing for the underfloor heating
room so that it matches the sensed conditions in other spaces.

heat_transfer_no_match.cfg - omitts the matching control for the upper
and lower bounding zones.
