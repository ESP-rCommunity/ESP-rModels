These are the water draw in L/h listing in columnar format for the associated XXDHW00Y.txt file
XX is the timestep minutes that each datapoint represents
Y refers as follows
	1 = 100 L/day average
	2 = 200 L/day average
	3 = 300 L/day average

The 6 minute timestep data does not appear in the original reports. It is likely that someone made these using the SuperPon.exe tool and then simply placed them in the folder.
