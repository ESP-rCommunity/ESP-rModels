These images were created using ParaView, which is a free,
open-source program. To output ESP-r CFD results in a
format compatible with ParaView, enter the CFD portion of
the res module, load the CFD results library and toggle to
the ParaView file format. As well as the directional glyphs
and streamlines demonstrated here, ParaView can create contour
plots, cut planes etc. Different visualisations can be layered
and animated.
