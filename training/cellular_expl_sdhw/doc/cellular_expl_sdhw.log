Instructions for running SDHW model

This model is a variant of the standard cellular_office model
which includes a water based solar collector (~3m^2), a 200 litre
insulated hot water storage tank located in the left corner of
the corridor zone. It also includes one water filled radiator
in each office.

The model uses thermal zones to represent these components and
fills them with water.  A flow network is used to connect the
components and controls are applied to the pumps in the system.
The pump associated with the solar collector is on if the top
of the collector is 3 degC warmer than the storage tank temperature.
The pumps for each radiator is on if the room temperature is below
22 degC (regardless of the tank temperature). There is also a
very small trickle circulator running between the tank and the
collector to limit extreme conditions in the collector.

To run an assessment in the project manager select the following:
  browse/edit/simulate -> simulation -> simulation presets
  select the spr option

  integrated simulation -> run interactively


There will be a some message about the flow solution not converging.
It might take one or two minutes to complete the spring assessment.
