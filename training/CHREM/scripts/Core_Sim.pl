# DESCRIPTION:
# This script is called from the simulation control script (Sim_Control_xx.pl).
# It reads the supplied core number arguement and opens the appropriate file 
# that lists the house directories to be simulated by that core.
# 
# The script determined the house name, changes directories to the appropriate 
# folder (to get RES and XML files right) and then simulates using bps and the 
# automation arguements.
