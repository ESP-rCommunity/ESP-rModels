There is one variant in this folder:

cellular_CFC.cfg, a basic version of cellular office featuring CFC
glazing for the large windows in manager_a and manager_b.

See *.glz files in the subfolder doc for information on the glazing
products used. Both CFC constructions additionally feature an external
venetian type blind which is controlled.

The layout of the rooms was taken from CAD data - e.g. the
surfaces are positioned in real-space. There is a ~50mm gap
between the rooms. The partitions are thermally connected
at the same time the geometry is separated.
