There is one variant in this folder:

cellular_PCM.cfg, a basic version of cellular office featuring PCM
materials in manager_a and manager_b.

The layout of the rooms was taken from CAD data - e.g. the
surfaces are positioned in real-space. There is a ~50mm gap
between the rooms. The partitions are thermally connected
at the same time the geometry is separated.
