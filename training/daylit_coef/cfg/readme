This model contains files that need to be converted:

For Linux
dec94_clm.a - use clm module to convert this ascii file to binary.
the model expects a file dec94.

The casual gain control files are populated with daylight
coefficients (calculated via the e2r module which takes
quite a bit of time).

The Radiance model has been regenerated to match current
versions of Radiance (R3.9 or newer).

The file facade_5.33.gz is a compressed trace for the five
minute lighting control for the december test period.
