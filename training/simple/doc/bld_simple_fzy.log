Synopsis: single zone, convective heating, fuzzy logic control
First created: Tue Jan 19 14:21:40 2021
Notes:
This model describes an L-shaped office conditioned via a convective
heating system with control based on a fuzzy logic algorithm.

5 membership sets are defined as follows.
    1. negative big (NB)
    2. negative small (NS)
    3. zero (ZR)
    4. positive small (NB)
    5. positive big (PB)

The control error and change of error at each simulation time-step are
mapped to a rule table to create a fuzzy output signal with a given input
normally triggering a number of rules, each contributing to an overall
fuzzy output signal. For example, if the error is NS and the change of
error NB then the output will be PB. If, on the other hand, the error
is PS and the change of error PB then the output is NB.

                       ERROR
            NB  NS  ZR  PS  PB
            ------------------
E  C   NB | PB  PB  PB  PS  ZR
R  H   NS | PB  PS  PS  ZR  NS
R  A   ZR | PB  PS  ZR  NS  NB
O  N   PS | PS  ZR  NS  NS  NB
R  G   PB | ZR  NS  NB  NB  NB
   E

The fuzzy output at each simulation time-step is then defuzzified by either 
the centre-of-area or the mean-of-max methods. For the model considered 
here, the center-of-area method is employed.
