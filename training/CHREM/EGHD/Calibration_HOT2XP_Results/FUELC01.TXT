Monthly Energy consumption data
-------------------------------

 DevFT[16]
----------
  There are currently 16 energy consumption "devices", [this 
should be expanded to 32 to accomodate new devices].  Associated with
each device is a designation of purpose, defined by the following table.

  Purpose
1 - Heating
2 - Cooling
3 - DHW
4 - Appliance

 EconMN[12][16]    - Monthly energy consumption (units as indicated below)
 EconAN[16]        - Annual    "         "

 0  - Primary space heating system (MJ for sure)
 1  - Secondary "     "      "     (MJ for sure)
 2  - Primary    DHW system (MJ)
 3  - Secondary  DHW system (MJ)
 4  - Electric baseload (kWh)
 5  - HRV + all fans  (kWh)
 6  - A/C energy + crankcase (but NOT indoor fan or ventilator) (kWh)
 7  - Supplementary Heating system #1 (MJ)
 8  -       "          "      "    #2 (MJ)
 9  - Fossil Gas (MJ)
10  -        Oil (MJ)

 FCOSTM[12][6]  -  Monthly fuel costs
 FCOSTA[6]      -  Annual    "    "

 0  - Electric
 1  - Natural gas
 2  - Oil
 3  - Propane
 4  - Wood
 5  - Total for all fuels

 NumDev  - Internal, set during calculations
 FCFLdd  - Set to true if fuel costs file loaded
 FRSet   - Set to true if fuel rate structures have been selected
 FCCalc  - Set to true to request fuel cost calcs (during annual calcs)
 FCCOK   - Internal, flag indicates that cost calulations are OK
