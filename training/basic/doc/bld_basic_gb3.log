Synopsis: multi-zone, convective heating, phased control
First created: Tue Jan 19 14:21:40 2021
Notes:
This model represents a 3 zone building with convective heating
under a global phased heating strategy control (an energy demand
reduction strategy adopted in a BEMS). This involves individual
control loop activation with the precondition that nominated loops
have ON status. For example, with a 3-loop control scheme with
sequence LOOP_3/LOOP_1/LOOP_2, LOOP_3 and LOOP_1 output must both
be non-zero for LOOP_2 to be activated.
