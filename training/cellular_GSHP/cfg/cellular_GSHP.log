_____________________________

There are three variants in this folder all of which are based on
the basic version of cellular office featuring CFC glazing for the 
large windows in manager_a and manager_b. All models feature an
explicit plant network.

1. cellular_GSHP.cfg
Space heat supplied by a one node GSHP.

2. cellular_GSHP2n
Space heat supplied by a two node GSHP.

3. cellular_icGSHP
Space heat and DHW supplied by a one node inverter controlled GSHP
using BCD data files in plant control. See icGSHP_Parameter.txt
in the doc subfolder for further information on the icGSHP.



All models:

See *.glz files in the subfolder doc for information on the glazing
products used. Both CFC constructions additionally feature an external
venetian type blind which is controlled.

The layout of the rooms was taken from CAD data - e.g. the
surfaces are positioned in real-space. There is a ~50mm gap
between the rooms. The partitions are thermally connected
at the same time the geometry is separated.
