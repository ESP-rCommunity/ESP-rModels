The flow networks were created via a scan of surface USE attributes
with user inputs. The facade grills are 20% of the surface area and
the return grills are 100% of surface area. Volume flow rates for the
fans should be equivalent to 5 air changes per hour.

office_vent_pre_3D_nvc.3dafn is the initial flow generated.

office_vent_pre_3D_nvc_b.3dafn is an alternative which has increased
the facade vents to 0.2m^2 as a test - this is overly large and results
in excessive natural ventilation in transition seasons.
