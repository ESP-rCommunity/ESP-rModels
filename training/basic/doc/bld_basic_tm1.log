Synopsis: multi-zone, convective heating, tracking control
First created: Tue Jan 19 14:21:40 2021
Notes:
This model represents a 3 zone building with convective heating
under control that coerces the roof zone temperature to match that
of the outside air. Sensor-matching control can be used to simplify
a model. For example, where an atrium is bounded by multiple similar
offices, only one office needs to be represented in detail; the
temperature of others, with simple representation, being matched to
this one throughout the simulation.
