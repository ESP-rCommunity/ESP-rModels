Synopsis: single zone, convective heating, low reflectivity external obstructions
First created: Tue Jan 19 14:21:40 2021
Notes:
This model describes an office with a convective heating system
under ideal control. External obstructions of low surface
reflectivity are included to and ESP-r's embedded shading/insolation
calculation method is activated to determine the added zone
solar gain due to external reflections.
