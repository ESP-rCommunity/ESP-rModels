This folder contains the climate information for use in simulating the house of the CSDDRD.

The hourly climate CWEC (Canadian Weather for Energy Calculations) files come from a checkout of esp-r:
svn co https://esp-r.net/espr/extras/climate

These result in the ./Install.sh script and a ./clm-dat_Canada folder which contains the ascii CWEC files for Canada.
By running the script the binary CWEC files for use in ESP-r were created. These are stored in the folder ./clm-bin_Canada

NOTE: the CWEC files require that the solar timing hour be centred. This is adjusted in the *.cfg file of a house model.
*slr_half_hr 1

Also included in this folder is a csv file  (Weather_HOT2XP_to_CWEC.csv) that cross references the many monthly weather locations in Canada to the nearest CWEC weather site. A lot of information regarding latitude, longitude, HDD, and CDD has been added for comparison. The file is tagged (*tag) for easy reading with perl.

The file includes the province and city name, as well as lat and long, and the corresponding CWEC weather file with its lat and long.

This folder also includes the output of perl scripts that read the CWEC information from the ascii files and stored it for use in generating the cross-reference file.
