*** CONCLUSIONS ***

Models may be broken up into several sets:

1. basic set
contains: basic.dfd, basiclma.dfd, basicsol.dfd, lma.dfd, sso.dfd
internal comparisons: 
  basic -> basiclma = shows influence of solving local mean age of air
  basic -> basicsol = shows result of rotating geometry
  basic -> lma      = shows result of rotating geometry (though differently to basicsol) AND solving local mean age of air
  basic -> sso      = shows result of including an extra small supply opening and increasing total inlet and outlet air flow 

2. blockage set
contains: block.dfd, blockc.dfd, blockh.dfd, blockt.dfd, blocklma.dfd, block2.dfd, block3.dfd, porous.dfd (make opening areas consistent?), tst33vol.dfd
internal comparisons:
  block -> blockc    = shows result of including a gaseous contaminant with a single source on a model with blockages
  block -> blockh    = shows result of including a humidity contaminant with a single source on a model with blockages
  block -> blockt    = shows result of making blockages heat sources and solving temperature and bouyancy (with ideal gas law) (also has different relaxation factors and convergence criteria)
  block -> blocklma  = i think this should show the result of solving local mean age of air on a model with blockages, however currently one of the blockages is much bigger; I'm fairly certain this is a mistake, I certainly can't see any reason for it
  block -> block2    = compares two different blockage arrangements, the latter creating a horizontal channel through which the inlet air should flow (also has different relaxation factors, convergence criteria and monitoring cell)
  block -> block3    = again compares two different blockage arrangements, the latter creating a vertical channel, though this is not alligned with any in/out-lets; personally i think it might be more useful to move this channel to align with the outlet (also has different relaxation factors, convergence criteria and monitoring cell; i think it may be be useful to make the monitoring cell more consistent between block and/or block2 and/or block3)
  block2 -> block3   = see above
  porous -> tst33vol = would show result of introducing a single additional blockage, if the two were made consistent in terms of in/outlet area (and possibly relaxation factors and convergence criteria)
other comparisons:
  basic -> block     = shows result of introducing 3 small blockages
  basic -> porous    = would show result of introducing a large "chequerboard" pattern of blockages in the y-z plane, again if the in/outlet areas were made consistent (and possibly the relaxation factors, convergence criteria and monitoring cell)

3. radiant panel set
contains: displ.dfd, displ_si.dfd
internal comparisons:
  displ -> displ_si = compares heat sources and heat sinks in terms of radiant panels on opposite walls (though could be worth making relaxation factors and convergence criteria a little more consistent)
other comparisons:
  basic -> displ    = shows result of including heated radiant panels and solving temperature and bouyancy (with ideal gas law)
  basic -> displ_si = as above, but with cooled radiant panels

4. contaminants set
contains: co2_so.dfd, hum_so.dfd
internal comparisons:
  co2_so -> hum_so = compares different contaminant cases; the former with 2 sources of a single gaseous contaminant and the latter with a source each of 2 contaminants, one gaseous (?) and one humidity
other comparisons:
  basic -> co2_so  = compares with and without contaminants
  basic -> hum_so  = as above, but with a different case of contaminants

5. temperature set
contains: tm1.dfd, tm1a.dfd, tm1b.dfd, tm1_so.dfd, tm2_so.dfd
internal comparisons:
  tm1 -> tm1a      = shows result of solving bouyancy (ideal gas law) as well as temperature (also relaxation factors and convergence criteria are different)
  tm1 -> tm1b      = would show result of solving bouyancy (Boussinesque approximation), if the inlet temperatures were made consistent (also relaxation factors and convergence criteria are different)
  tm1a -> tm1b     = would directly compare ideal gas law and Boussinesque approximation if the two were made compatible in terms of inlet temperature (and possibly relaxation factors and convergence criteria)
  tm1a -> tm1_so   = would show the result of including heat sinks inside the room, if the inlet temperatures were made consistent (also relaxation factors and convergence criteria are different)
  tm1b -> tm2_so   = would show the result of including heat sources inside the room, if the inlet temperatures were made consistent (also relaxation factors and convergence criteria are different)
  tm1_so -> tm2_so = could directly compare heat sinks and sources, if bouyancy formulation was made consistent (also relaxation factors and convergence criteria are different)
other comparisons:
  basic -> tm1     = would show result of solving temperature, if the inlet temperature was made consistent

6. others
contains: bi-cg.dfd, hugegrid.dfd [see individual notes for these above]
