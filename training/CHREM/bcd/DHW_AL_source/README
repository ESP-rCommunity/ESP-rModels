NOTE THAT THE DHW AND AL ORIGINALLY HAD DOS END OF LINE CHARACTERS. CHECK THIS IF HAVING ISSUES (i.e. CHANGE TO UNIX END OF LINE CHARACTERS).
THIS DATA WILL BE USED FOR SUBSEQUENT AVERAGING TO OBTAIN VALUES FOR THE PARTICULAR TIMESTEP.

The can_gen are generated appliance and lighting (AL) contains power profiles for use with ESP-r in fcl format. 
These are listed in Watts (W) with 12 timesteps per hour (row), each for 5 minutes, resulting in 1 h per row.
There is 8760 lines corresponding to each hour of a year.
There are two header rows that describe a 'year' and timesteps per hour

*****UPDATE*****
Aug 2009: We recieved the detailed profiles that break down the AL consumption into its components. This was sent by Marianne Armstrong of the NRC.
These have been placed in their original form in the subdirectory titled 'DHW_AL_source_detail_orig'.
Their 'organized' form has been placed in this working directory (e.g. can_gen_low_Y1.csv). These files should be used to replace the *.fcl files.

The domestic hot water (DHW) files are the water draw in L/h listing in columnar format for the associated XXDHW00Y.txt file
XX is the timestep minutes that each datapoint represents
Y refers as follows
	1 = 100 L/day average
	2 = 200 L/day average
	3 = 300 L/day average

The 5 minute timestep data does not appear in the original reports. It is likely that someone made these using the SuperPon.exe tool.
