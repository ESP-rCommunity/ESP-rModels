3br_tt_det_Bat.cfg - zero energy house with detailed systems

- LiIon battery included in electrical grid (grid-side AC / DC coupling does not seem to really work, battery charge / discharge is via the control routines)
- different (experimental) control strategies available:
	- M2-0: Basic controller w/ battery charged by PV 
	- M2-1: "grid rate" / "grid refund" based control of battery management
	- M2-2: as above, changed threshold values
