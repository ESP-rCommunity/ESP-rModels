A 4 zone model with diffeent occupant representations
applied to each zone:
  manager_a   - prescribed occupants;
  manager_b   - dynamic two node (core/skin) model active;
  manager_E+  - heat gains calculated from the energyPlus
                polynomial equation;
  manager_ASH - heat gains are calculated from the ESP-r 
                polynomial equations based on operative
                temperature and metabolic rates.
