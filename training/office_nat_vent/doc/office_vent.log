_____________________________
 
The Office_nat_vent folder contains a series of high resolution
office models focused on a portion of an office block. They
explore natural ventilation issues. The configuration
files are as follows:

office_vent_pre_nonet.cfg - base case model with scheduled
infiltration and ideal controls.

office_vent_hvac_infil.cfg - model with infiltration-only
facade leakage and active HVAC zone environmental controls.

office_vent_pre_nvc.cfg - model with facade vents controlled
for natural ventilation and which HVAC zone environmental
controls with constant fans.

office_vent_pre_nv_hvac.cfg - model with hybrid natural 
ventilation control of facade with controlled HVAC fans.

office_vent_pre_nv_hvac_3k.cfg - as _nv_hvac.cfg but
with capacity in HVAC zones constrained to 3kW.

The April pre-defined assessments are best for demonstrating
the interaction between a natural ventilation scheme and an
air based environmental control regime.
