Synopsis: adjacent offices with CFD domains imposed.
First created: 1 August 2005.
Notes: 
This model demonstrates the multi-zone CFD functionality of ESP-r. It includes
the following features.
- A building model comprising two adjacent offices and a connecting corridor.
- A flow network representing window ventilation, inter-zone air flow and
  a mechanical extract in the corridor.
- A control system that emulates user behaviour in relation to window opening
  and regulates the indoor temperature.
- CFD domains imposed on the three zones to model intra-zone air movement. These
  domains are conflated with the above flow network to represet inter-zone air
  flow and intra-zone air movement together.

To demonstrate the trade-off between accuracy and run time, the two office zone
CFD domains have different gridding schemes. Zone manager_a has a grid of
30x30x30 cells (higher resolution grids will be slow to simulate on all
but the most powerful computers). Zone manager_b has a grid of 15x15x15 cells
(1/8th of the former). This is quicker to process but at the expense of model
fidelity. For example, window frames are modelled as distinct surfaces. This is
not a problem in the first zone as the higher resolution grid enables the
direct connection of CFD domain cells with window frame parts. Conversely, in
the second zone the coarser grid means that the CFD domain cells are too large
to be directly assigned to the window frames so that this particular detail
is lost to the CFD domain. There are several other examples in the model where
detail that is encapsulated in the higher resolution CFD grid is lost in the
coarser grid.

It is interesting to compare simulations undertaken with this model and the
related model without cfd domains. Note the significant reduction in the run
time in the latter case and the difference in the results from both quantitative
and qualitative viewpoints.

During the first hour of CFD solution activation, select the 'marked converged'
option if the solutions does not converge.
