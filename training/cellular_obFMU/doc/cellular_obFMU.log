This model demonstrates cosimulation with obFMU, the IEA-EBC Annex 66 
occupant behaviour toolkit. To use this model as intended, ESP-r must be
compiled with FMI support and obFMU must be downloaded. Instructions for 
doing this can be found in the FMI users guide at:
[ESP-r installation directory]/manual/FMI/Users.txt

The obCoSim.xml and obXML.xml files are provided, which define the zone
mapping between the model and obFMU and the behaviour models. These are
intended to work with the simulation preset "test", which simulates for
1 week at the beginning of February.

The model is designed to simulate with stochastic occupant movement and
stochastic behaviour models. Selected outputs from one such simulation 
can be found in the images folder. These show heating, casual gains, and
air flow through windows which demonstrate obFMU in action.

There are two occupants in this model; Billy and Benny. Billy occupies
the zone called "manager_a" and Benny occupies "manager_b". Benny is
somewhat more environmentally conscious than Billy, which is reflected
in the behaviour models assigned to them for lighting, heating and
windows.

Behaviour models (defined in obXML.xml) are:

  Lighting
    Billy's models
      B_L1: 95% chance of turning lights on when entering a room.
      B_L2: Increasing chance of turning lights on as light level 
            decreases from 500 lux.
      B_L3: 95% chance of turning lights off when leaving a room for 
            more than 6 hours, as long as no-one else is in the room.
    Benny's models
      B_L4: Increasing chance of turning lights on as light level
            decreases from 400 lux.
      B_L5: 98% chance of turning lights off when leaving a room, as
            long as no-one else is in the room.
      B_L6: Increasing chance of turning lights off as light level
            increases from 400 lux.

  Heating
    Billy's models
      B_AC1: 98% chance of turning heating on when entering a room.
      B_AC3: Increasing chance of turning heating on as temperature
             decreases from 21 degrees C.
      B_AC4: 95% chance of turning heating off when leaving a room for 
             more than 6 hours, as long as no-one else is in the room.
    Benny's models
      B_AC5: Increasing chance of turning heating off as temperature
             increases from 25 degrees C.
      B_AC6: Increasing chance of turning heating on as temperature
             decreases from 20 degrees C.
      B_AC7: 98% chance of turning heating off when leaving a room, as
             long as no-one else is in the room.

  Windows
    Billy and Benny both use these models
      B_W1: Increasing chance of opening windows as CO2 concentration
            increases from 1000 ppm.
      B_W2: 98% chance to close windows when leaving a room for more
            than 6 hours.
    Benny has one extra model
      B_W3: Increasing chance to close windows as temperature decreases
            from 21 degrees C.

  Setpoints
    Billy and Benny use the same models
      B_Therm1: In winter heating and cooling setpoints are 21 degrees
                C.
      B_Therm2: In spring an autumn heating and cooling setpoints are
                22.5 degrees C.
      B_Therm3: In summer heating and cooling setpoints are 24 degrees 
                C.
  
  Blinds
    Billy and Benny use the same models
      B_Blind_1: 95% chance to open blinds when entering a room.
      B_Blind_2: 95% chance to close blinds when leaving a room for more
                 than 6 hours.

  Plug loads
    Billy and Benny use the same models
      B_PL1: 100% chance to turn equipment on when entering room.
      B_PL2: 98% chance to turn most equipment off (0.3 fraction on 
             gains) when leaving a room for more than 6 hours, as long
             as no-one else is in the room.

  Movement
    Billy and Benny use the same models
      B_M_Manager:
        80% of time at work spent in their own offices, with an average
        duration of 90 minutes.
        10% of time at work spent in the other's office, with an average
        duration of 30 minutes.
        10% of time at work spent outside the model, with an average 
        duration of 10 minutes.
        Arrival is at 08:00 at the earliest, has 20% chance of occuring
        by 08:30, 80% chance of occuring by 09:00, and 100% of occuring
        by 09:30.
        Departure typically occurs around 18:00, but can occur as early
        as 17:30.
        They typically leave for lunch around 12:00, but can do as early
        as 11:00; lunch typically takes around 60 minutes, minimum 30 
        minutes.

The differences between Billy and Benny's behaviours can be observed in
the example results provided. For example, it can be seen in the heating
results that Billy's office uses significantly more heating energy, 
largely due to Billy being forgetful and leaving the heating on twice 
when she goes home! It can also be seen that Benny is rather more 
inclined to use natural daylight, turning the lights off in his office 
more often than Billy.

Because the simulation is stochastic, your results will be different
from those shown in the example images. Try a few simulations and see
what happens! You could even try fiddling with the behaviour models, 
perhaps replacing them with some of the existing behaviour models that
are distributed with the obXML schema:
