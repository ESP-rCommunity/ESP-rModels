Notes:
This model is the same zone replicated five times to explore
the use of zone casual gain control.
 1 basecase  basecase describes a 3mx5mx2.5m office with facade
 2 cgc_a     cgc_a is as base case but with cgc control via analytic df
 3 cgc_b     cgc_b similar to cgc_a but with user specified df
 4 cgc_c     cgc_c similar to cgc_a but with external surface sensor
 5 cgc_d     cgc_d as cgc_b but with Hunt probability switching
 6 cgc_e     cgc_e with radiance coupling every timestep
 
For each casual gain (lighting) control is enabled on weekdays only.

Note: because of the coupling simulations run slowly.
