Synopsis: multi-zone, convective heating, load shedding control
First created: Tue Jan 19 14:21:40 2021
Notes:
This model represents a 3 zone building with convective heating
under ideal control in which heating loads are shed according to
a specified zone sequence (as a means to maintain the total demand
within a given limit).
