Project notes for Multi-story carpark with rooftop PV.
_____________________________
Notes: 

This model represents a multi-story carpark with a roof top
PV array.  One variant includes the PV array at a normal
angle, one with added ducted wind turbines in at the corners
of the building one with DWT and a horizontal PV array.

Most of the thermal zones represent open parking areas with
administrative facilities on the ground level. The PV array
is embedded in surfaces associated with a PV zone. The internal
structure of the building is represented as visual bodies.

Adjacent buildings are represented via solar obstructions. The
site topology is explicitly represented via a ground zone. This
added resolution supports visualisation studies.

A conference paper reporting on this project is included in
this folder.
